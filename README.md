# Arduino-Projects

I'm working on arduino and sharing to this repository. During my studying and learning phase i'm gonna share the codes with full details.


# 09.04.2022 ( Alert-System )

At this project i used :

* 1 Arduino Nano
* 1 Potantial meter
* 1 LED ( Red )
* 1 LED ( Yellow )
* 1 LED ( Green )
* 1 Temperature and Humidity sensor ( DHT11 )
* 20 Jumper wire

# 10.04.2022 ( Alert-System v2.0 With Button )

* Button has been added to the system with all its requirements
* Resistor used

# 16.04.2022 ( Basic synchronization of DHT11 with LEDs )

At this project i used :

* 1 Arduino Nano
* 1 LED ( Red )
* 1 LED ( Yellow )
* 1 LED ( Blue )
* 1 Temperature and Humidity sensor ( DHT11 )
* 12 Jumper wire
* 1 Button ( With 4 pins )
* 1 Resistor ( 1k Ohm )

# 17.04.2022 ( wifi(Node MCU - ESP8266) - DHT11 )

* Node MCU
* DHT11
* 3 Jumper Wire
